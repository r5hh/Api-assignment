Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1.

            "Host About": "Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1. Submit a photo of yourself on your profile.\r\n2. Submit a phone number (mobile), email address and verify some form of identification [See https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 for more information about Verified ID].\r\n3. Fill out information about yourself so we know who to expect.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are yet to join Airbnb, but are just browsing our place for an affordable place to stay close to Newtown, you should follow this link www.airbnb.com.au/c/smenteith to join up. You will get some free Airbnb travel credit for your second trip and we'll get some Airbnb travel credit too.",

                "About": "Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1. Submit a photo of yourself on your profile.\r\n2. Submit a phone number (mobile), email address and verify some form of identification [See https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 for more information about Verified ID].\r\n3. Fill out information about yourself so we know who to expect.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are yet to join Airbnb, but are just browsing our place for an affordable place to stay close to Newtown, you should follow this link www.airbnb.com.au/c/smenteith to join up.

It could be a little bit closer to subway (you have to walk 10 minutes or more to get to it) but you also have other means of transport to move. The neighbourhood is lovely, quiet, safe and full of shops of any kind. Inside the apartment everything was very clean and nice. New or almost new sheets and towels as well as an almost fully equipped kitchen (a microwave is missing). The bed was very comfortable and wifi and air conditioning worked perfectly. The relationship price quality is perfect. We definitely recommend this apartment for a young couple like us.",

Ya que consta de una cama matrimonial y un sofá que no es cama, salvó que quieras dormir en un colchón inflable pinchado. En el departamento convivirás con ratones que te comen tus alimentos si los dejas fuera del refrigerador. Las sábanas a pesar de estar lavadas tenían manchas de suciedad y no pretendas encontrar un plato o vaso igual al otro. No te dan la dirección exacta hasta 10 minutos antes de entrar 15 hs. Así qué deambularas por la cuidad con tus maletas. Si esto no es suficiente tengo fotos que lo demuestran, solamente escríbeme a mi correo y te las mandare. Espero que esta opinión te sirva para no tener que perder el dinero como me paso a mi, ya que tuve que hospedarme en un hostel cercano. Suerte",

The guests staying in the apartment before me missed their flight but Maria (and Marie, from halfway across the world) managed to find a solution which worked for all of us.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is quite charming and really cozy. Although I was out most of the time, I managed to flip through a couple of interior design books. There were nice little touches too, like new magazines and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood, of course, is pretty quiet and safe. I managed to lock myself out (with my phone in the apartment) less than fifteen minutes before my ride to the airport was supposed to arrive, but the super was super helpful (no pun intended).\r\n\r\nTaxis are pretty easy to hail nearby (York/1st Ave). There's also a crosstown-bus stop a couple of minutes away, at 79th & York. The Met is a fifteen-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I would definitely stay in Marie's and Maria's apartment again.",

                "About": "Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1. Submit a photo of yourself on your profile.\r\n2. Submit a phone number (mobile), email address and verify some form of identification [See https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 for more information about Verified ID].\r\n3. Fill out information about yourself so we know who to expect.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are yet to join Airbnb, but are just browsing our place for an affordable place to stay close to Newtown, you should follow this link www.airbnb.com.au/c/smenteith to join up. You will get some free Airbnb travel credit for your second trip and we'll get some Airbnb travel credit too.",

                "About": "Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1. Submit a photo of yourself on your profile.\r\n2. Submit a phone number (mobile), email address and verify some form of identification [See https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 for more information about Verified ID].\r\n3. Fill out information about yourself so we know who to expect.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are yet to join Airbnb, but are just browsing our place for an affordable place to stay close to Newtown, you should follow this link www.airbnb.com.au/c/smenteith to join up. You will get some free Airbnb travel credit for your second trip and we'll get some Airbnb travel credit too.",

                "About": "Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1. Submit a photo of yourself on your profile.\r\n2. Submit a phone number (mobile), email address and verify some form of identification [See https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 for more information about Verified ID].\r\n3. Fill out information about yourself so we know who to expect.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are yet to join Airbnb, but are just browsing our place for an affordable place to stay close to Newtown, you should follow this link www.airbnb.com.au/c/smenteith to join up. You will get some free Airbnb travel credit for your second trip and we'll get some Airbnb travel credit too.",

I stayed for a night, enjoyed sleeping in the cozy bedroom area of the car, and dined in the dining area. Even did some writing in the little railcar office. It's a little spooky at night, but in a fun way. You're staying in a piece of history! Margaret and her husband and their dogs are incredibly welcoming and kind and went out of their way to make my stay wonderful. Thanks, Margaret!",

Place appeared nice and clean, had all the kitchen utilities I needed. Even brought me over some milk for a cup of tea!  Mosquitoes were apparently a bit of an issue, but I didn’t even notice as Steven had gone to measures to try and stop it from being a problem with sprays, creams ect. Had Everything for it and I wasn’t annoyed by one once. \nJust make sure you read about the smoking policy if you’re a smoker, as You must smoke on the street, off the property.  Was great for my quick stay. Thank you!",

Incredibly convenient to all areas in Porto and accessible to transportation; within walking distance to the Douro River and major historical sights. There is a bakery in front of the building; great restaurants and cafes nearby. \nThe pictures of the apartment on the website don’t do justice to the actual place, which is much nicer, lovely with lots of sunlight during the day, and nicely decorated. It was exceptionally clean and the kitchen, completely equipped. The host kindly offered us a bottle of wine upon our arrival. \nWe had a very enjoyable stay, highly recommended!",

The outdoor kitchen, fireplace and the train itself are beautiful and the photos don’t do it justice. I’m hoping to send through some new photos we took of the train to further show what’s on offer. Only a short walk away is a river for swimming and there’s a few paths for short bush walks. Anyone interested in the local history will get a kick out of some of the ‘Easter eggs’ around the train- with commemorative photos. Definitely recommend getting the fire going and cooking outdoors- bring bug spray! Would recommend to anyone- and looking forward to staying again.",

The train carriage itself is cozy and well-appointed for two guests - with cooking facilities, chairs and benches for lounging, and a private room to retire in. We enjoyed the games that were provided, as well as reading about some of the history of the railroads in the greater Sydney area. We hope to visit again soon!",

Ik zou dit appartement aanbevelen als je met zijn 2e bent, je hebt ook geen woonkamer of iets. Dan heb je nog een balkon, waar je met zijn 2e op kan zitten, maar met 4 personen niet. Verder reageren ze erg snel en was het schoon.",

It was a family trip and we couldn't enjoy it more, the house looks as good as in the photos and the team managing it are very polite and helpful.  We had our privacy, and no - the lack of curtains has not been a problem to us (because this could never be a real problem). The view from the terrace are great and we spent the afternoons having coffees and watching the sundown. The cleaning team is very nice and they did a great job, everything shined when we arrived. We also ordered the breakfast which was delicious, so fresh and healthy! The house is big and spacious and we liked the design. Location is perfect right next to the beach but also close to the city center. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Ipanema and we can't wait to get back! Thanks a lot Alex and the team!",

It is a short walk to the lower end of King Street, Newtown, and maintains the traditions of old Newtown.  Marrickville Metro (shopping centre) is very close too for supermarket shopping.  There is a lot of road construction going on at the moment, but Steven's place is a nice, retro haven away from the excesses of Sydney, yet close to the buzz of Newtown, St Peters station, and (as a result) many places connected via public transport.  Steven is the type of host you wish you had more time to spend chatting with.  It is a real 'airbnb' experience - living like a local - a Newtown local.  Steven isn't just someone making a buck, he's offering a local experience.  Steven describes the place honestly...if you want a sparkling Sydney harbour experience, look to the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney.  This is Newtown of old - and the better for that.",

Tentei contato com a empresa, mas não mes responderam. Precisei entrar pela janela e forçar a chave com muita força para podermos sair. Quase perdemos a viagem de trem que havíamos comprado.\nSomente após eu entrar em contato em outro dia, a empresa me respondeu e consertou a porta.\n\n2 - Comprei 11 diárias, mas só havia um rolo de papel higiênico disponível. Solicitei mais e a empresa me atendeu.\n\n3 - Não havia como limpar o apartamento, pois não há vassoura ou pá.\n\n4 - O forno não funcionava direito.\n\n5 - A geladeira só funcionava se colocada no nível máximo. Toda vez que a deixei abaixo da temperatura mais fria, ela desligou e minha comida estragou. Quando coloco no máximo para que ela se mantenha ligada, os alimentos congelam e, por isso,  perdi minha salada.\n\n6 - O apartamento dispõe de dois quartos: um pequeno sem varanda e um grande com varanda. Arrumaram para mim o menor sem varanda e apenas um travesseiro tinha fronha.",

I was looking for somewhere quiet and relaxing to do some reading and writing, and a friend had recently raved about her weekend spent staying in this beautiful restored train carriage. It was just what I needed, and Margaret and her family were extremely generous and welcoming to me. It was such an easy trip from Sydney centre and is surrounded by beautiful bushland, creeks and rivers. I would recommend it to any person or couple looking for a relaxing and lovely little getaway. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!",

Everything was delightful - from the wonderfully preserved vintage interiors, to the thoughtful modern upgrades, to the beautiful bush setting. Best of all was the kindness of the hosts - Margaret not only came to pick me up from the station, but also stocked the train carriage with simple, delicious supplies (sourdough bread, tomatoes, eggs, fresh basil etc) so I could make my own meals in the tiny kitchen. Other highlights include the hammock/day-bed which was perfect for reading in the sun, and the three gorgeous dogs who were endlessly playful and amusing. I would recommend this place to railway enthusiasts, vintage lovers, and anyone who wants to immerse themselves in nature. I hope to stay in this beautiful place again! ",

We also had a family bbq at the premises on one of the days, and the hosts were absolutely fantastic. There were 20 of us at the bbq, and there was ample room and Margaret was very accommodating and obliging. Excellent facilities!\nThe communication with Margaret was excellent, she made sure we knew everything we needed to make this a memorable stay. \nWe will definitely think about booking this for other treat train enthusiasts we know.

The shower has plenty of hot water but once again is compact. The bed is comfortable and the living area quite spacious. Train enthusiasts will particularly enjoy checking out the many original artifacts that decorate the spaces. \nThe accommodation is located a few kilometres from the train station so a car is recommended. There are some beautiful bushland walks leading to the George's River that are well worth exploring and Sydney is about 50 minutes by train.\nWe would highly recommend Margaret's place, especially for short stays. We loved the convenience of being close to everything yet being on the edge of bushland and the river. We also enjoyed interacting with Margaret's three dogs that live on the property and look forward to returning when we return to the area.",

We called, texted, messaged numerous times and couldn't contact them until 10am that day. That was a bit disappointing. Other than that the house was great, comfortable bed and soundproof environment. The kitchen doesn't have all the essentials such as oil, only salt. The free wine and water was a nice touch, but still having all the necessary amenities for cooking away from home was more important. Overall a good stay.",

Even though she was away the weekend we were staying she organised for a friend to meet us and gave us all the information we needed before we arrived. She also left us fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as food for breakfast which was a lovely surprise! \r\n\r\nThe railway carriage itself is a wonderful space and full of historical touches. It is easy to see that a lot of love and work has gone into the carriage and it truly felt like a home away from home. It was very relaxing waking up right next to the bush, and located a short drive away from shops and other bushwalks. We also loved getting to meet Margaret's dog and puppies! \r\n\r\nWe look forward to hopefully staying at the railway carriage again in the future - perfect for a weekend escape from the city! \r\n",

Como pontos positivos posso citar a localização, a cozinha bem equipada e com coisas novas, camas e travesseiros de boa qualidade. Como ponto negativo principal foi o mau cheiro do banheiro do quarto, muito forte. Outro ponto é a questão do estacionamento, que entendi quando aluguei que era do imóvel, mas, no entanto, é em um estacionamento privativo próximo. Quando cheguei ao local, o responsável pela casa que me recebeu informou que voltaria no penúltimo dia para reembolsar o valor gasto com o estacionamento, mas não foi o que aconteceu.\r\nQuando liguei me passaram que deveria encaminhar por email os comprovantes de pagamento, e assim seria feito o reembolso. Não tenho como afirmar se funcionou ou não, pois até o momento ainda não obtivemos respostas sobre o assunto. Tirando esses pequenos\r\npercalços, tudo foi excelente.

I would highly recommend this Penthouse to anyone and everyone. I will certainly be staying here again with family and friends. Thank you kindly Camille and Alex and your staff ! \r\n\r\nNothing was too much trouble and Alex went above and beyond to make sure we were looked after, day and night.  The breakfast was also amazing - delivered freshly made to our door and prepared in our kitchenThe penthouse  is even better as it appears on the website and what a location, we were right on the Beach of Ipanema, steps away from our now new favorite brazilian restaurant Garota de Ipanema where I tasted one of the best steaks I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we missed was the nice weather during our stay as we came during a rainy week, however  we were able to watch movies in the living space on a projector screen which was pretty awesome!  There is a supermarket, bank, taxis, restaurants, metro station, ATM’s, Starbucks, Bar, and fast foods less than 5 minutes walk away and you must try ‘Polis Sucos’ just around the corner for the best fruit juices and Acai .\r\nThe other feedback is just to be clear about your expectations from the staff, they are happy to be working around your wishes and be present or absent depending on how you would like and plan your holiday, and it also comes down to the language barrier so just let Alex know what you would like when you arrive if you do not speak portuguese. We had a wonderful time and can't recommend the Alex or the Penthouse enough.  ",

It had been beautifully restored and the hosts had clearly invested a lot of thought and effort into creating a one of a kind step-back-in-time experience. The hosts were very warm and welcoming, and were an incredible source of information about the train as well as the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nThe food provided for us to use, along with the presentation of the in-carriage dining table really gave it that extra first-class 20th century touch. Although shops were conveniently located a 15 minute drive away, the property is isolated giving the carriage a very embedded-in-bushland glamping feel. \r\n\r\nOne of our best Airbnb stays to date - would definitely recommend.",

She also helped me move all my belongings on the the day I moved into my new home. John and Margaret also took me out for dinner with their friends, which was a really lovely evening.\nThe property is very beautiful, there is trees everywhere and a lot of nice sitting opportunities to hang out. You can go for walks and do bicycle tours in the surrounding forest, there is also a river not to far away.\nThe carriage is a very special place to stay. There are so many unique, beautiful and old details and everything works very well (lights, shower, wifi...).\nThe kitchen is equipped with everything you need and Margaret had set fruits and filled up the fridge.\nThe bed is super comfy and even got warm heating blankets.\nI would love to return to the carriage which was my nest for about a week. \nThank you so much Margaret and John!\n",

Also very good air conditioning in each bedroom. \r\n\r\nThat all said, the apartment in real life does not look nearly as nice as it does in the photos. Each bathroom is a hodgepodge of different plumbing fixtures. One shower has the boiler controls in the wall inside the shower.  Water in the front unit (with balcony) ran hot and cold which made showering interesting.  Also a toilet in one of the front bedrooms has an electric pump to help it flush.  This is fine, except it also had a water leak from the tank to the bowl so the pump was activated every few minutes and the noise made sleeping in the bedroom impossible. The whole place could use a professional paint job. Overall it's a nice space with great potential but all feels a little too unfinished for what they are charging.",

Ya que consta de una cama matrimonial y un sofá que no es cama, salvó que quieras dormir en un colchón inflable pinchado. En el departamento convivirás con ratones que te comen tus alimentos si los dejas fuera del refrigerador. Las sábanas a pesar de estar lavadas tenían manchas de suciedad y no pretendas encontrar un plato o vaso igual al otro. No te dan la dirección exacta hasta 10 minutos antes de entrar 15 hs. Así qué deambularas por la cuidad con tus maletas. Si esto no es suficiente tengo fotos que lo demuestran, solamente escríbeme a mi correo y te las mandare. Espero que esta opinión te sirva para no tener que perder el dinero como me paso a mi, ya que tuve que hospedarme en un hostel cercano. Suerte",

The guests staying in the apartment before me missed their flight but Maria (and Marie, from halfway across the world) managed to find a solution which worked for all of us.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is quite charming and really cozy. Although I was out most of the time, I managed to flip through a couple of interior design books. There were nice little touches too, like new magazines and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood, of course, is pretty quiet and safe. I managed to lock myself out (with my phone in the apartment) less than fifteen minutes before my ride to the airport was supposed to arrive, but the super was super helpful (no pun intended).\r\n\r\nTaxis are pretty easy to hail nearby (York/1st Ave). There's also a crosstown-bus stop a couple of minutes away, at 79th & York. The Met is a fifteen-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I would definitely stay in Marie's and Maria's apartment again.",

Incredibly convenient to all areas in Porto and accessible to transportation; within walking distance to the Douro River and major historical sights. There is a bakery in front of the building; great restaurants and cafes nearby. \nThe pictures of the apartment on the website don’t do justice to the actual place, which is much nicer, lovely with lots of sunlight during the day, and nicely decorated. It was exceptionally clean and the kitchen, completely equipped. The host kindly offered us a bottle of wine upon our arrival. \nWe had a very enjoyable stay, highly recommended!",

The outdoor kitchen, fireplace and the train itself are beautiful and the photos don’t do it justice. I’m hoping to send through some new photos we took of the train to further show what’s on offer. Only a short walk away is a river for swimming and there’s a few paths for short bush walks. Anyone interested in the local history will get a kick out of some of the ‘Easter eggs’ around the train- with commemorative photos. Definitely recommend getting the fire going and cooking outdoors- bring bug spray! Would recommend to anyone- and looking forward to staying again.",

The property is located on a pleasant and secluded acreage, were you'll be gently woken by bird calls and the wind in the trees. The train carriage itself is cozy and well-appointed for two guests - with cooking facilities, chairs and benches for lounging, and a private room to retire in. We enjoyed the games that were provided, as well as reading about some of the history of the railroads in the greater Sydney area. We hope to visit again soon!",

It was a family trip and we couldn't enjoy it more, the house looks as good as in the photos and the team managing it are very polite and helpful.  We had our privacy, and no - the lack of curtains has not been a problem to us (because this could never be a real problem). The view from the terrace are great and we spent the afternoons having coffees and watching the sundown. The cleaning team is very nice and they did a great job, everything shined when we arrived. We also ordered the breakfast which was delicious, so fresh and healthy! The house is big and spacious and we liked the design. Location is perfect right next to the beach but also close to the city center. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Ipanema and we can't wait to get back!

It is a short walk to the lower end of King Street, Newtown, and maintains the traditions of old Newtown.  Marrickville Metro (shopping centre) is very close too for supermarket shopping.  There is a lot of road construction going on at the moment, but Steven's place is a nice, retro haven away from the excesses of Sydney, yet close to the buzz of Newtown, St Peters station, and (as a result) many places connected via public transport.  Steven is the type of host you wish you had more time to spend chatting with.  It is a real 'airbnb' experience - living like a local - a Newtown local.  Steven isn't just someone making a buck, he's offering a local experience.  Steven describes the place honestly...if you want a sparkling Sydney harbour experience, look to the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney.  This is Newtown of old - and the better for that.",

Tentei contato com a empresa, mas não mes responderam. Precisei entrar pela janela e forçar a chave com muita força para podermos sair. Quase perdemos a viagem de trem que havíamos comprado.\nSomente após eu entrar em contato em outro dia, a empresa me respondeu e consertou a porta.\n\n2 - Comprei 11 diárias, mas só havia um rolo de papel higiênico disponível. Solicitei mais e a empresa me atendeu.\n\n3 - Não havia como limpar o apartamento, pois não há vassoura ou pá.\n\n4 - O forno não funcionava direito.\n\n5 - A geladeira só funcionava se colocada no nível máximo. Toda vez que a deixei abaixo da temperatura mais fria, ela desligou e minha comida estragou. Quando coloco no máximo para que ela se mantenha ligada, os alimentos congelam e, por isso,  perdi minha salada.\n\n6 - O apartamento dispõe de dois quartos: um pequeno sem varanda e um grande com varanda. Arrumaram para mim o menor sem varanda e apenas um travesseiro tinha fronha.",

Everything was delightful - from the wonderfully preserved vintage interiors, to the thoughtful modern upgrades, to the beautiful bush setting. Best of all was the kindness of the hosts - Margaret not only came to pick me up from the station, but also stocked the train carriage with simple, delicious supplies (sourdough bread, tomatoes, eggs, fresh basil etc) so I could make my own meals in the tiny kitchen. Other highlights include the hammock/day-bed which was perfect for reading in the sun, and the three gorgeous dogs who were endlessly playful and amusing. I would recommend this place to railway enthusiasts, vintage lovers, and anyone who wants to immerse themselves in nature. I hope to stay in this beautiful place again! ",

Tentei contato com a empresa, mas não mes responderam. Precisei entrar pela janela e forçar a chave com muita força para podermos sair. Quase perdemos a viagem de trem que havíamos comprado.\nSomente após eu entrar em contato em outro dia, a empresa me respondeu e consertou a porta.\n\n2 - Comprei 11 diárias, mas só havia um rolo de papel higiênico disponível. Solicitei mais e a empresa me atendeu.\n\n3 - Não havia como limpar o apartamento, pois não há vassoura ou pá.\n\n4 - O forno não funcionava direito.\n\n5 - A geladeira só funcionava se colocada no nível máximo. Toda vez que a deixei abaixo da temperatura mais fria, ela desligou e minha comida estragou. Quando coloco no máximo para que ela se mantenha ligada, os alimentos congelam e, por isso,  perdi minha salada.\n\n6 - O apartamento dispõe de dois quartos: um pequeno sem varanda e um grande com varanda. Arrumaram para mim o menor sem varanda e apenas um travesseiro tinha fronha.",

            "Comment": "Staying in this beautiful train carriage is one of the nicest Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Everything was delightful - from the wonderfully preserved vintage interiors, to the thoughtful modern upgrades, to the beautiful bush setting. Best of all was the kindness of the hosts - Margaret not only came to pick me up from the station, but also stocked the train carriage with simple, delicious supplies (sourdough bread, tomatoes, eggs, fresh basil etc) so I could make my own meals in the tiny kitchen. Other highlights include the hammock/day-bed which was perfect for reading in the sun, and the three gorgeous dogs who were endlessly playful and amusing. I would recommend this place to railway enthusiasts, vintage lovers, and anyone who wants to immerse themselves in nature. I hope to stay in this beautiful place again! ",

The shower has plenty of hot water but once again is compact. The bed is comfortable and the living area quite spacious. Train enthusiasts will particularly enjoy checking out the many original artifacts that decorate the spaces. \nThe accommodation is located a few kilometres from the train station so a car is recommended. There are some beautiful bushland walks leading to the George's River that are well worth exploring and Sydney is about 50 minutes by train.\nWe would highly recommend Margaret's place, especially for short stays. We loved the convenience of being close to everything yet being on the edge of bushland and the river. We also enjoyed interacting with Margaret's three dogs that live on the property and look forward to returning when we return to the area.",

It was very relaxing waking up right next to the bush, and located a short drive away from shops and other bushwalks.

Como pontos positivos posso citar a localização, a cozinha bem equipada e com coisas novas, camas e travesseiros de boa qualidade. Como ponto negativo principal foi o mau cheiro do banheiro do quarto, muito forte. Outro ponto é a questão do estacionamento, que entendi quando aluguei que era do imóvel, mas, no entanto, é em um estacionamento privativo próximo. Quando cheguei ao local, o responsável pela casa que me recebeu informou que voltaria no penúltimo dia para reembolsar o valor gasto com o estacionamento, mas não foi o que aconteceu.\r\nQuando liguei me passaram que deveria encaminhar por email os comprovantes de pagamento, e assim seria feito o reembolso. Não tenho como afirmar se funcionou ou não, pois até o momento ainda não obtivemos respostas sobre o assunto. Tirando esses pequenos\r\npercalços, tudo foi excelente. Voltaria com certeza para a casa em questão.",

I would highly recommend this Penthouse to anyone and everyone. I will certainly be staying here again with family and friends. Thank you kindly Camille and Alex and your staff ! \r\n\r\nNothing was too much trouble and Alex went above and beyond to make sure we were looked after, day and night.  The breakfast was also amazing - delivered freshly made to our door and prepared in our kitchenThe penthouse  is even better as it appears on the website and what a location, we were right on the Beach of Ipanema, steps away from our now new favorite brazilian restaurant Garota de Ipanema where I tasted one of the best steaks I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we missed was the nice weather during our stay as we came during a rainy week, however  we were able to watch movies in the living space on a projector screen which was pretty awesome!  There is a supermarket, bank, taxis, restaurants, metro station, ATM’s, Starbucks, Bar, and fast foods less than 5 minutes walk away and you must try ‘Polis Sucos’ just around the corner for the best fruit juices and Acai .\r\nThe other feedback is just to be clear about your expectations from the staff, they are happy to be working around your wishes and be present or absent depending on how you would like and plan your holiday, and it also comes down to the language barrier so just let Alex know what you would like when you arrive if you do not speak portuguese. We had a wonderful time and can't recommend the Alex or the Penthouse enough.  ",

Enorme, cheia de ótimos quartos e com uma área externa maravilhosa.\r\nAlex e Camille, MUITO OBRIGADO. De verdade!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex and Camille are simply sensationals. Not only as individuals but also as zealous hosts for their guests.\r\nI have only praise to give to them and simply wonderful and heavenly mansion with them rent.\r\nThanks to the treatment they gave me before, during and after our stay, I can say it was a weekend I will never forget and that, God willing, one day not too far I'll be able to repeat.\r\nThe mansion is beautiful, very well located, with taxi rank, pharmacy, market and bakery on the same block. Huge, full of great rooms and a wonderful outdoor area.\r\nAlex and Camille, THANK YOU. Really!",

Not the cheapest accomodation by a long shot, but considering the class and character of the reconditioned railway carriage (actually suprisingly spacious, except for the kitchenette), the beautiful forest location - its a good deal. Margaret and her husband is a friendly and engaging couple, provided quality breakfast ingredients and just took great care of us. We particularly enjoyed inviting 9 people over and entertaining them at the pavillion !",

Also very good air conditioning in each bedroom. \r\n\r\nThat all said, the apartment in real life does not look nearly as nice as it does in the photos. Each bathroom is a hodgepodge of different plumbing fixtures. One shower has the boiler controls in the wall inside the shower.  Water in the front unit (with balcony) ran hot and cold which made showering interesting.  Also a toilet in one of the front bedrooms has an electric pump to help it flush.  This is fine, except it also had a water leak from the tank to the bowl so the pump was activated every few minutes and the noise made sleeping in the bedroom impossible. The whole place could use a professional paint job. Overall it's a nice space with great potential but all feels a little too unfinished for what they are charging.",

Ya que consta de una cama matrimonial y un sofá que no es cama, salvó que quieras dormir en un colchón inflable pinchado. En el departamento convivirás con ratones que te comen tus alimentos si los dejas fuera del refrigerador. Las sábanas a pesar de estar lavadas tenían manchas de suciedad y no pretendas encontrar un plato o vaso igual al otro. No te dan la dirección exacta hasta 10 minutos antes de entrar 15 hs. Así qué deambularas por la cuidad con tus maletas. Si esto no es suficiente tengo fotos que lo demuestran, solamente escríbeme a mi correo y te las mandare. Espero que esta opinión te sirva para no tener que perder el dinero como me paso a mi, ya que tuve que hospedarme en un hostel cercano. Suerte",

The guests staying in the apartment before me missed their flight but Maria (and Marie, from halfway across the world) managed to find a solution which worked for all of us.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is quite charming and really cozy. Although I was out most of the time, I managed to flip through a couple of interior design books. There were nice little touches too, like new magazines and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood, of course, is pretty quiet and safe. I managed to lock myself out (with my phone in the apartment) less than fifteen minutes before my ride to the airport was supposed to arrive, but the super was super helpful (no pun intended).\r\n\r\nTaxis are pretty easy to hail nearby (York/1st Ave). There's also a crosstown-bus stop a couple of minutes away, at 79th & York. The Met is a fifteen-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I would definitely stay in Marie's and Maria's apartment again.",

Highlights of our stay included bush walks, \" brekkie with the lot\" using the fresh ingredients Margaret provided, and a relaxing day trip to the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum (Thirlmere) and Australian Botanic Garden (Mt Annan).

No tuvimos cosas básicas que normalmente encuentras en los pisos de Airbnb: sal, aceite, champú (había solo 4 pequeñitos para usar y tirar para 4 días y 4 personas) y etc. Es más como servicio de un hotel que un piso normal.

Tentei contato com a empresa, mas não mes responderam. Precisei entrar pela janela e forçar a chave com muita força para podermos sair. Quase perdemos a viagem de trem que havíamos comprado.\nSomente após eu entrar em contato em outro dia, a empresa me respondeu e consertou a porta.\n\n2 - Comprei 11 diárias, mas só havia um rolo de papel higiênico disponível. Solicitei mais e a empresa me atendeu.\n\n3 - Não havia como limpar o apartamento, pois não há vassoura ou pá.\n\n4 - O forno não funcionava direito.\n\n5 - A geladeira só funcionava se colocada no nível máximo. Toda vez que a deixei abaixo da temperatura mais fria, ela desligou e minha comida estragou. Quando coloco no máximo para que ela se mantenha ligada, os alimentos congelam e, por isso,  perdi minha salada.\n\n6 - O apartamento dispõe de dois quartos: um pequeno sem varanda e um grande com varanda. Arrumaram para mim o menor sem varanda e apenas um travesseiro tinha fronha.",

Everything was delightful - from the wonderfully preserved vintage interiors, to the thoughtful modern upgrades, to the beautiful bush setting. Best of all was the kindness of the hosts - Margaret not only came to pick me up from the station, but also stocked the train carriage with simple, delicious supplies (sourdough bread, tomatoes, eggs, fresh basil etc) so I could make my own meals in the tiny kitchen. Other highlights include the hammock/day-bed which was perfect for reading in the sun, and the three gorgeous dogs who were endlessly playful and amusing. I would recommend this place to railway enthusiasts, vintage lovers, and anyone who wants to immerse themselves in nature. I hope to stay in this beautiful place again! ",
